- 👋 Hi, I’m electropus, im a 15 year old dutch dev that makes projects in a lot of different languages but i am best at C# and java
- 👀 I’m interested in getting better at programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and javascipt
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of projects, for me its not about the end result its about how i made it
- 📫 How to reach me: i rarely check my mail so best thing you could do is send me a dm on insta: marijns_alt_account
- I've worked on a lot of projects that i did not put on here so i'll make a list:
Multiple utility plugins for minecraft 1.19.2 bukkit
A couple discord bots, 
A love tester website, 
Some roblox games and i've also worked on my own roblox exploit GUI.
